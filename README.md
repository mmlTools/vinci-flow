# Smart Lower Thirds - Professional OBS Studio Plugin

![Plugin Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plugin-Smart%20Lower%20Thirds-blue)

**Create, manage, and display unlimited lower thirds directly inside OBS Studio.**  
No local webserver. No scene binding. Uses a **local file Browser Source** workflow.

---

## What it does
Smart Lower Thirds helps you build professional lower thirds for streams, podcasts, interviews, live shows, and presentations - with a clean dock, templates, and fast triggering.

---

## Main features
- **Unlimited lower thirds** - create as many as you need (hosts, guests, topics, sponsors, socials, announcements).
- **Local file Browser Source workflow** - overlays are loaded from local HTML files inside OBS (no localhost URL/ports).
- **Dock + settings dialog** - manage items and customize styling (text, colors, fonts, animations, position).
- **Hotkeys support** - trigger lower thirds quickly during live production (Stream Deck friendly via OBS hotkeys).
- **Timed lower thirds (optional automation)** - auto-show every X seconds and stay visible for Y seconds (set interval to `0` to disable).
- **Template packs** - import/export designs to reuse across projects and share with others.
